This report details the purpose, design considerations, functionality, and the utilization of GitHub and
GitHub Actions in the development of the Tamagotchi app. The app will allow users to care for a virtual
pet on their smartphones or digital devices, mimicking the original toy’s experience. This app will also
allow the user to feed, play with and attend to their virtual pets to keep them happy and healthy. The
design prioritizes user interest through interactive elements and intuitive interfaces, while GitHub and
GitHub Actions ensure faultless collaboration and automation in the development process.
The Tamagotchi app is designed to bring a timeless game back to the present, allowing users to revisit
history while having fun at the same time taking care of their virtual pet. Users will have various options
to keep them entertained, from playing with their virtual pet, to feeding their pet as well as making sure
their pet is clean.
The primary purpose of the Tamagotchi app is to entertain users and keep users busy to help them pass
the time. In the same sense, the app will also teach users a sense of responsibility as they will be
responsible for making sure their virtual pet is well taken care of, happy and is healthy.
User Interface (UI) Design: The app features a playful and inviting design, with an animated dog as the
central character. The “Welcome Page” introduces users to the app, encouraging them to “Get Started!”
Tabs for “Feed,” “Clean,” and “Play” are strategically placed, allowing users to interact with the virtual
pet. The inactive tabs provide a clear indication of available actions.
Dynamic Dog Design:
The dog’s appearance changes based on user interactions. When the user selects “Feed,” the dog is
shown eating from a bowl. Choosing “Clean” may result in a cleaner, happier dog. “Play” could show the
dog in a playful pose.
This dynamic design enhances user engagement and reinforces the connection between actions and
outcomes.
Responsive Layout:
The consistent layout across screens ensures a seamless user experience. Elements like the dog’s
position and tab placement remain unchanged, promoting familiarity.
The app adapts well to different screen sizes, making it accessible on various devices.
Gamification:
By simulating pet care, the app taps into users’ emotional connection with animals. Gamified
interactions (feeding, cleaning, playing) create a sense of responsibility and engagement.
Visual cues (such as the dog’s changing appearance) enhance the game-like experience.
The app's functionality revolves around the pet reacting to the different inputs selected by the user.
Such as the mood/image of the virtual pet changing when the clean,feed or play button is selected. This
will then update the status icon that monitors the virtual pet's health and mood.
GitHub and GitHub Actions play a crucial role in the development of the Tamagotchi app. GitHub
facilitates faultless collaboration, version control, and code management, ensuring seamless integration.
GitHub Actions automates various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying the app, using
continuous integration and continuous delivery principles. This ensures the reliability and efficiency of
the development process.
In conclusion, the Tamagotchi app offers an engaging and fun way for users to have fun and learn crucial
responsibility life skills. By leveraging intuitive design, robust functionality, and the power of GitHub and
GitHub Actions, the app provides a timeless and exciting experience for users. The Tamagotchi app has
room for future development and growth where more interactive designs and options can be made
available for users to furthermore interact with their virtual pet, such as a sleep monitor and another
option such as having multiple pets.
This expanded report provides a comprehensive overview of the Tamagotchi app, detailing its purpose,
design, functionality, and the role of GitHub and GitHub Actions in its development.
Future updates/versions of the Tamagotchi app could include additional features such as sleep monitor,
having the option to have more than one virtual pet and the option of choosing from a variety of pets. It
is a great way to broaden the user experience and explore the needs and responsibilities of different
pets which will further prepare users for a more real-life scenario if they choose to have a pet by
learning to first care for their virtual pet.
